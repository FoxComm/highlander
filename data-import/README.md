# Scripts to import test products into the system. 

    ```
    python3 src/main.py <host> <command> <max products?>
    ```

1. Host specifies the host of the API to import into.
2. Command can be "taxonomies", "products", or "both".
3. Max products is optional and provides a way to restrict how many are imported
