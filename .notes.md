### Ansible

1. ansible should be installed with pip in order - brew version doesn't support dnsimple module
	1. workaround is to create link to python lib dir in macOS's ~/Library and add search path for default path(<http://stackoverflow.com/a/32238132>)
2. looks like `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL` env var changed to `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
3. do we need to restart mesos_consul after reloading nginx(WTF?)? looks like consul does not see app from mesos after it(or some other event, don't remember exactly)...
