# Remote

Remote is a service for controlling and changing channels across all of the
platform services. It integrates directly with Phoenix, Solomon, Middlewarehouse,
and River Rock to ensure that all are using correct and up-to-date channel
information.

It also exposes an API to Ashes that allows channels to be managed by a store
admin.
