## Shipments [/v1/inventory/shipmints]

Shipments track the status of items that have been purchased and are scheduled
to be sent from a store to a 3rd party, such as a customer.

_Shipment States_

- **Pending**: the initial state when a new shipment is created. It means that
  the shipment exists in the warehouse and is in the process of being readied
  for shipment.
- **Shipped**: the shipment has left the warehouse and is in the process of
  being fulfilled.
- **Delivered**: the recipient has received the shipment.
- **Cancelled**: the shipment has been cancelled and inventory has been made
  available to other customers.

### View By Order [GET /v1/inventory/shipments/{referenceNumber}]

Gets all of the shipments associated with a single order.

+ Parameters
    + referenceNumber: `BR10001` (required, string) - Order reference number.
+ Response 200 (application/json)
    + Attributes (array[ShipmentResponse])

### Create [POST /v1/inventory/shipments]

This is the manual shipment creation endpoint. Use this if you want to have
precise control over how the shipments are created and the logic for splitting
them. In order for the shipment to be created successfully, the following
conditions must be met:

1. The items that you're attempting to ship must have been reserved by the
   order that's associated with the shipment. This step is automatically
   performed by the OMS API when checkout occurs.

   For more details on the reserved status, please see the `StockItems` API
   in this document.

2. The items that you're attempting to ship may not be a part of any other
   shipment.

3. All items that you're attempting to ship must exist in the same stock
   location. Since a shipment represents the bundle of items leaving a stock
   location, it's necessary that all items must be able to be shipped from the
   same location.
