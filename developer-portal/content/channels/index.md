# Channels Guide

The Fox Platform allows you to sell your products to external channels. Currently
we support selling to [Amazon.com](www.amazon.com).

## Amazon

FoxCommerce is your central hub for managing your orders and customers. You can
export your products to Amazon and keep track of orders and customers within the Platform.
