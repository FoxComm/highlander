# Inventory

The Fox Platform allows you to manage inventory across your warehouses. 
Inventory is automatically integrated with the Order Management System.

## Quickstart

## Learn More

### Stock Keeping Units (SKUs)

The Fox Platform allows you to define the attributes of the good you are selling
including price, size, landing cost independent of inventory.

- [Add and remove SKUs](skus.html)

### Stock Items

The Physical item in a location is known as a Stock Item. The Fox Platform keeps track 
of each individual item with it's own state allowing a more flexible and accurate 
system for tracking your inventory. The inventory is not simply a number on the SKU.

- [Add and remove inventory](items.html)

### Stock Locations

The Fox Platform can manage Stock Items across locations, whether it is separate warehouses
or locations within a single warehouse.

- [Manage Locations](locations.html)

### Shipping Methods

You can manage your shipping methods and providers using the inventory system.
Shipping Methods can have arbitrary complex rules which allow for better display
and selection in the storefront.
