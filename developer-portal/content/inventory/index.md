# Inventory Quickstart

The Fox Platform allows you to manage inventory across your warehouses. 
Inventory is automatically integrated with the Order Management System.

## Stock Keeping Units (SKUs)

The Fox Platform allows you to define the attributes of the good you are selling
including price, size, landing cost independent of inventory.

## Stock Items

The Physical item in a location is known as a Stock Item. The Fox Platform keeps track 
of each individual item with it's own state allowing a more flexible and accurate 
system for tracking your inventory. The inventory is not simply a number on the SKU.

or locations within a single warehouse.
