# Activity Events

The Fox Platform creates detailed events for all activity in the system. 
These events are both accessible via the Admin interface and programmatically. 

## Viewing Activity Events

You can view events via the Admin interface for all activity in the system.

## Handling Activity Events Programmatically

All activity is recorded in an event stream which can be tapped programmatically.
This allows extending the system via a [Reactive Programming model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming).
