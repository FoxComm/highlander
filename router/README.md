# Router                                                                         

Router is a reincarnation of the original FoxComm Router that was built back in
2014. In our new world, it is used to understand the actions happening on 3rd
party sites and convert them into semantic events that can be used by the core
platform.

Router is, therefore, core in helping expose FoxCommerce services, such as cross
sells and conversational commerce, to existing Magento and Spree installations,
and is a useful tool in helping to migrate existing sites.

## Current Roadmap

[ ] Keep track of checkout actions against default Magento
[ ] Log a summary of the action taken to the command line
[ ] Determine user that performed checkout action
[ ] Determine item purchased
[ ] Keep track of PDP views
