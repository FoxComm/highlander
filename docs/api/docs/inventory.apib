## Group Stock Level Summaries

Stock Level Summaries allows a user to see levels of inventory available across
various inventory types and stock locations.

_Inventory Types_

- **Sellable**: the standard inventory type. Units in this state are considered to
  be in-stock and available in a stock location.
- **Non-sellable**: inventory that is in a stock location but not allowed to sold.
  One example would be inventory that has been received in a warehouse from a
  manufacturer, but is not yet put in to bins.
- **Backorder**: the amount of inventory that is either available for backorder or
  has already been backordered.
- **Preorder**: the amount of inventory that is either available for preorder or
  has already been preordered.

_Inventory Count Definitions_

- **On Hand**: refers to the number of units that are sitting within a given stock
  location. Depending on other states, these may or may not be available for
  sale.
- **Hold**: units that have been purchased, but are in one of the hold order states
  (Manual Hold, Fraud Hold, Remorse Hold). If an outside WMS or 3PL is
  connected to FoxCommerce, these units will not show up as purchased in that
  system. Units that are in this state cannot be purchased by other customers.
- **Reserved**: units that are in the process of being fulfilled.
- **AFS**: the number of units that are available for sale. This is a calculated
  field (afs = on hand - hold - reserved).
