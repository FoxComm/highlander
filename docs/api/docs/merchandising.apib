# Merchandising Admin

The FoxCommerce Content and Merchandising system flexibly stores product and
merchandising information. The endpoints in this section allow an administrator
to create items for purchase and control data so that a customer is more likely
to purchase from the store.

 All information is stored in a specific **context**
and every change is automatically versioned.

Currently, Merchandising is broken down into the following core concepts:

- Context
- Products
- SKUs
- Variants
- Albums
- Taxonomies

In addition, each of the core objects (Products and SKUs) may be categoried
by tags and categories.

<!-- include(objects/album.apib) -->
<!-- include(objects/object.apib) -->
<!-- include(objects/product.apib) -->
<!-- include(objects/variant.apib) -->
<!-- include(objects/taxonomy.apib) -->

## Group Products

## Group SKUs

<!-- include(admin_skus.apib) -->

## Group Variants

<!-- include(admin_variants.apib) -->

## Group Taxonomies

<!-- include(admin_taxonomies.apib) -->

Albums represent a way to group and share images across different entities in the system.
