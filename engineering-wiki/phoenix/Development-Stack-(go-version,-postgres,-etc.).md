Use Golang 1.4.2 (or latest stable release).

Use Postgres 9.3.5. (9.4 is the latest but we will have upgrade production data at a later point to reach it; see http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/release-9-4.html).

Other versions may work for you. If so, that's fine, but the above will be configured for Wercker, which should be considered the objective source of truth as CI.
