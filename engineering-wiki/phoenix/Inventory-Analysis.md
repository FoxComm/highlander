# Road map features (from [Beta Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/a/crowdint.com/document/d/1HBgbvvwyCKMf3cuxRIYjeTJli--qTaxDTXP4YegG-cE/edit#))
## Provisioning
- Store owner will configure the FoxComm ERP with a 3PL for Inventory integration and reporting
  - Store owner decides which 3PL they are going to use (hopefully with an API key or token)
  - Integration between FoxComm ERP and 3PL controls the communication and polling loops between the two systems
  - Thought: we need to have our own ERP abstraction
- The store owner creates a manifest and FoxComm transmits it to the 3PL
  - This may have migration implications when coming from other platforms (such as Spree and Magento)
- Store owner will set up shipping categories (default, hazardous) in Inventory
- Store owner will set up return rules (e.g. can be returned, return window, restocking fee) in Inventory
- FoxComm polls the 3PL to discover updates about the inventory and itâ€™s levels
- FoxComm will notify the store owner when there is in an error syncing with the 3PL
- FoxComm will generate a polling report/dashboard about the connection with the 3PL

## Checking out
- Store customer can confirm checkout and place an order
  - A transaction lock is built on our inventory levels so the order can be assured.
  - Order is placed with 3PL to organise delivery.
