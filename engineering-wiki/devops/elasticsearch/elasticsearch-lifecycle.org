#+TITLE: ElasticSearch Lifecycle

* Overview

We use ElasticSearch as our main source of caching and as a search engine
across the FoxCommerce platform. In order to use it correctly, we must create
and update indicies, manage mappings per scope, and push information to ES. This
document outlines how we approach those problems.

* Manage Mappings

This section covers how we create an manage mappings across ElasticSearch. There
are a number of challenges when doing this, including:

- Creating initial mappings
- Synchronizing the ES table contents with PostgreSQL tables
